# Team Handbook

## Welcome to Our Team!

This handbook contains essential information for all team members about our processes, policies, and best practices.

## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow

We follow a feature branch workflow:

1. Create a new branch from `main` for each feature or bug fix
2. Make your changes and commit them with descriptive messages
3. Push your branch and create a pull request
4. Get at least one code review approval
5. Merge to `main` using squash and merge

### Code Review Process

All code changes must go through our review process:

- At least one senior developer must approve
- All CI/CD checks must pass
- Code must follow our style guidelines
- Tests must be included for new features

## Deployment Process

### Staging Environment

1. All merges to `main` automatically deploy to staging
2. QA team tests all changes in staging
3. Product owner approves staging releases

### Production Deployment

1. Create a release branch from `main`
2. Update version numbers and changelog
3. Deploy to production during maintenance window
4. Monitor for 30 minutes post-deployment
5. Rollback if any critical issues are detected

## Coding Standards

### Python Guidelines

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Maximum line length of 88 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Include docstrings for all classes and functions

### JavaScript Guidelines

- Use ES6+ features when possible
- Follow Airbnb JavaScript style guide
- Use meaningful variable names in camelCase
- Include JSDoc comments for functions
- Use async/await instead of callbacks

## Testing Standards

### Unit Tests

- All new functions must have unit tests
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

### Integration Tests

- Test critical user journeys
- Include both happy path and error scenarios
- Run integration tests before each deployment

## Communication Guidelines

### Daily Standups

- Every weekday at 9:00 AM
- Share what you worked on yesterday
- Share what you plan to work on today
- Mention any blockers or help needed

### Slack Channels

- `#general` - Team announcements and general discussion
- `#development` - Technical discussions and code-related questions
- `#deployments` - Deployment notifications and status updates
- `#random` - Non-work related conversations

## Onboarding Process

- Optimize for readability first, performance second

### Application Monitoring

- Monitor response times and error rates
- Set up alerts for critical thresholds
- Review performance metrics weekly
- Plan optimization sprints quarterly

## Emergency Procedures

### Incident Response

1. Assess the severity of the incident
2. Notify the on-call engineer immediately
